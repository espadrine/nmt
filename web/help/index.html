<h1> Game Help </h1>

<p>
Welcome to Not My Territory (Yet).
</p>
<p>
This is a game of collaborative exploration, construction and simulation.
You are one of many leaders of a country, and your goal is to strive and
overwhelm opposite countries. Once your empire has struck down all enemies,
your name will be put on the throne, and a new game will start.
<p>

<h2> Basics </h2>
<p>
At the start of the game, if you are the first one online, you will notice that
you have three <a href=food.html>starving</a> folks dancing around on a tile.
You can <a href=travel.html>move</a> them by left-clicking on their tile,
pressing the "travel" button, and left-clicking on the tile you want to go to.
You can make those folks <a href=build.html>build</a>, destroy the building
they're on, and split groups by clicking on the corresponding buttons at the top
left.
</p>
<p>
You start in your camp's spawn area. The first thing I recommend you do is zoom
out (press the "-" key) and find people in opposite camps. Then, focus on your
camp and improve it. If you're starting a game, your folks are starving: make
them build a farm, then a residence. That will help you increase your
<a href=population.html>population</a>.
</p>

<h2> Advanced controls </h2>
<p>
There are several mapped keys to allow you to perform actions faster.
