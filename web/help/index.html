<h1> Game Help </h1>

<p>
Welcome to Not My Territory (Yet).
</p>
<p>
This is a game of collaborative exploration, construction and simulation.
You are one of many leaders of a country, and your goal is to strive and
overwhelm opposite countries. Once your empire has struck down all ennemies,
your name will be put on the throne, and a new game will start.
<p>

<h2> Basics </h2>
<p>
At the start of the game, if you are the first one online, you will notice that
you have a single person and a plot of <a href=./farm.html>farm land</a>.
You can move that person by left-clicking on her tile, and left-clicking on the
tile you want her to go to. You can make that person build, destroy the building
she's on, and reproduce by right-clicking on the tile.
