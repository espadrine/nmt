<h1> Hunger & Fuel </h1>

<p>
Every time your folks go in a <a href=farm.html>farm</a>, they gain 20 units of
food / fuel. As they <a href=travel.html>travel</a>, their stock of food
diminishes. It does so by 1 every move, except when using planes: those beasts
require expensive kerosene, they cost 2 per move.
</p>
<p>
When their stock of food is really low, folks will start to complain. When it is
empty, they will stop obeying to you and stay where they are. You then need to
ask them to build a farm wherever they are, to let them move again. Of course,
that means that they can get stuck and lost at sea.
