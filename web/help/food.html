<h1> Hunger & Fuel </h1>

<p>
Every time your folks go in a <a href=farm.html>farm</a>, they gain 20 units of
food / fuel. As they <a href=travel.html>travel</a>, their stock of food
diminishes. It does so by 1 every move, except when using planes: those beasts
require expensive kerosene, they cost 2 per move.
</p>
<p>
When their stock of food is really low (≤ 3), folks will start to complain.
When it is empty, half of them will die every time you force them to move,
until there is no one left standing. You need to ask them to build a farm
wherever they are, to avoid losing them all. Of course, that means that they
can be lost at sea with no recourse but death. (In extreme cases, you can still
save a group by carrying food to them from another group.)
</p>
<p>
Food is the reason you need to carefully prepare your trips. Indeed, you will
lose folks on the way because they will regularly have to build farms. Go with
a large amount of folks. Also, it is recommended to restock your group's
supplies by going to a nearby farm, when they have a long journey ahead of
them.
