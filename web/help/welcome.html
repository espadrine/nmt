<h1> Game Help </h1>

<p>
Welcome to Not My Territory (Yet).
</p>

<h2> Basics </h2>
<p>
At the start of the game, if you are the first one online, you will notice that
you have three <a href=food.html>starving</a> folks dancing around on a tile.
You can <a href=travel.html>move</a> them by left-clicking on their tile,
pressing the second button, and left-clicking on the tile you want to go to.
You can make those folks <a href=build.html>build</a> through the third button.
Finally, you can locate <a href=war.html>enemies</a> and <a
  href=treasure.html>important locations</a> through the fourth button.
</p>
<p>
You start in your camp's spawn area. The first thing I recommend you do is zoom
out (press the "-" key) and find people in opposite camps through the "places"
(fourth) button.
Then, focus on your camp and improve it. If you're starting a game, your folks
are starving: make them build a farm, then a residence. That will help you
increase your <a href=population.html>population</a>.
