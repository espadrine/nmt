<h1> Game Help </h1>

<p>
Welcome to Not My Territory (Yet).
</p>
<p>
This is a game of collaborative exploration, construction and simulation.
You are one of many leaders of a country, and your goal is to strive and
overwhelm opposite countries. Once an enemy has been struck down, if your empire
is the greatest, your name will be put on the throne, and a new game will start.
<p>

<h2> Basics </h2>
<p>
At the start of the game, if you are the first one online, you will notice that
you have three <a href=food.html>starving</a> folks dancing around on a tile.
You can <a href=travel.html>move</a> them by left-clicking on their tile,
pressing the "travel" button, and left-clicking on the tile you want to go to.
You can make those folks <a href=build.html>build</a> and split groups by
clicking on the corresponding buttons at the top left.
Finally, you can locate <a href=war.html>enemies</a> and <a
  href=treasure.html>treasures</a> through the "places" button.
</p>
<p>
You start in your camp's spawn area. The first thing I recommend you do is zoom
out (press the "-" key) and find people in opposite camps through the "places"
(fourth) button.
Then, focus on your camp and improve it. If you're starting a game, your folks
are starving: make them build a farm, then a residence. That will help you
increase your
<a href=population.html>population</a>.
