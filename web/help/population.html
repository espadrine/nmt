<h1> Population </h1>

<p>
Each camp's population is the number of folks that are part of that camp on the
whole map. That population is always higher than or equal to the population cap.
It can be higher thanks to surrendering enemies, and will usually decrease
because of <a href=war.html>wars</a>,
</p>
<p>
The population cap is directly equal to the number of homes (2 homes in a
<a href=residence.html>residence</a>, and 6 in
a <a href=skyscraper.html>skyscraper</a>) that you occupy.
Your population increases up to the population cap instantly.
Every new folk that you get is added on one of your home tiles.
As a result, building more houses and invading cities both help you get more
people.
</p>
<p>
However, you can only grow up to the <strong>population limit</strong>, set to
100 folks. Past that, you can increase that limit by 100 folks for every
<a href=build.html>university</a> that you control. Careful, you can only
construct one on <a href=treasure.html>citrus</a> tiles: you may have to fight
to control a university!
