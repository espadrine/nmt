<h1> Population </h1>

<p>
Each camp's population is the number of folks that are part of that camp on the
whole map. That population can decrease because of <a href=war.html>wars</a>,
and will increase up to the population cap at every turn (unless the population
is past that cap).
</p>
<p>
The population cap is directly equal to the number of homes (1 home in a <a
  href=farm.html>farm</a>, 2 in a <a href=residence.html>residence</a>, and 6 in
a <a href=skyscraper.html>skyscraper</a>) that you occupy.
At the end of every turn, your population increases up to the population cap.
Every new folk that you get is added randomly on one of your home tiles.
As a result, building more houses (and leaving people in them!) and invading
cities both help you get more people.
