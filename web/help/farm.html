<h1> Farm Land </h1>

<p>
A plot of farm land can be built any time everywhere except on water.
Going to a farm gives you 20 units of <a href=food.html>food</a>.
However, building a farm costs you a gentle folk. Farming, after all, requires
the constant care of a dedicated farmer.
</p>
<p>
Farms also give you one unit of <a href=wealth.html>wealth</a>,
two if you add a worker, three if you add two.
