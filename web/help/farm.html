<h1> Farm Land </h1>

<p>
A plot of farm land can be built any time on <a href=./zones.html>steppes,
  hills and mountains</a> (basically everywhere except in forests and on water).
A person cannot move farther on land than 64 tiles from the nearest farm.
A destroyed farm can potentially kill people.
</p>
<p>
Farms also provide a food source to <a href=./city.html>cities</a>. Connect a
bunch of farms to the city through a road to provide food to that city and help
expand it.
