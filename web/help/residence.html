<h1> Residence </h1>

<p>
A residence is a building, usually found in cities, that increases the
<a href=population.html>population</a> cap by 2. It requires 2 farm tiles around it
to be built.
As for all homes, it needs to be occupied to work.
It is also useful in the creation of <a href=skyscraper.html>skyscrapers</a>,
<a href=build.html>factories</a>, <a href=build.html>docks</a>
and <a href=travel.html>walls</a>.
