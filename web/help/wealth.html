<h1> Wealth </h1>

<p>
One of the <a href="resources.html">resources</a>, wealth can be simply
collected by making <a href="farm.html">farms</a>, but that is very inefficient.
The best way to collect wealth is to build <a href="build.html">fields</a> on
commodities. In a particularly traded commodity, say, poultry, if you own the
only poultry field, you gain 50 wealth.
The more poultry fields you own, the more wealth you gain, up to 100 wealth.
Your gain is also a percentage of your market share.
The exact formula is 50 × market share × (2 - 1 ÷ owned fields).
</p>
<p>
<em>Scarce commodities</em> are therefore likely to be more valuable.
<em>Pockets</em> of a single commodity contain a lot of value and are easier to
defend. Focusing on a few commodities can allow you to own more of that market,
and get more value out of it.
</p>
<p>
On the flip side, if you want to reduce the wealth of an enemy that relies on a
particular commodity, try to own a region of the map where that commodity is
very present. You can also attack their fields.
</p>
<p>
Wealth is necessary to build monuments and stock exchanges, which you need three
of for a Prosperity Victory, two of for an Industrial Victory, one of for an
Intellectual Victory.
