<h1> Travel and Speed </h1>

<p>
How fast traveling through a tile is depends on its
<a href=./zones.html>type</a>. Traveling through mountains and going through
slopes takes more time. Some tiles have special conditions to be able to cross
them, such as water, swamp, and walls.
</p>

<p>
Each person has a certain speed, depending on how she is equiped. By default, her
speed is 8, that is, she can walk a cumulated distance of 8 at once.
With a <a href=./manufacture.html>car</a>, her speed would be 16.
On a <a href=./manufacture.html>boat</a>, it would be 20.
By <a href=./manufacture.html>plane</a>, 32.
However, if a tile contains some ennemies, the person cannot go past that tile.
She has to stop on it and <a href=./war.html>fight</a>.
</p>
<p>
Water and swamps cannot be crossed barefoot, nor with a car.
You need <a href=./manufacture.html>boats</a> to sail through them,
although <a href=./manufacture.html>planes</a> also work.
