<h1> Travel and Speed </h1>

<p>
How fast traveling through a tile is depends on its
<a href=./zones.html>type</a>. Traveling through mountains and going through
slopes takes more time. How difficult it is depends on what mode of
transportation you are using.

<p>
Each person has a certain speed, depending on how they are equipped. By default,
their speed is 8, that is, they can walk 8 tiles on roads in a single go.
A <a href=./manufacture.html>car</a> doubles their speed, regardless of mode
of transportation.
</p>
<p>
If a tile contains some enemies, the person cannot go past that tile.
They have to stop on it and <a href=./war.html>fight</a>.
</p>
<p>
Water and swamps cannot be crossed barefoot, nor with a car.
You need <a href=./manufacture.html>boats</a> to sail through them,
although <a href=./manufacture.html>planes</a> also work.
</p>
<p>
When traveling, mind your <a href=./food.html>food supply</a>. You may need to
build <a href=./farm.html>farms</a> along the way, which will cost you folks.
Still, you probably want to depart will all the food you can carry, by making a
stop at a farm first. That will top if off to 20 food: each step will cost 1
food (2 for planes). Without food, half the group will die of hunger until
nobody is left.
