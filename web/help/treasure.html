<h1> Treasures </h1>

<p>
When the map is created, certain tiles appear with certain properties.
Creating special buildings on those tiles usually yields benefits.
A limited number of them is shown at once on the map. The total number is fixed,
and the new ones appear farther and farther away from the center of the map as
players use them.

<ul>
  <li> Black Death: propagate the most dangerous disease of all times by
  building an <a href=build.html>airport</a> on an abandonned house still
  holding live germs. Of course, you are immune. Your ennemies aren't so lucky:
  they will lose all their folks on farms, residences and skyscrapers, up to
  half of their population!
  </li>
  <li> Metal: there is no industry revolution without metal. Build a
  <a href=build.html>Mine</a> to extract some. Gather 13 to win an
  Industrial Victory.
  </li>
  <li> Citrus: health is the most determinant factor in order to grow from a
  small society to a great developed country.
  Build a <a href=build.html>Hospital</a> to increase your
  <a href=population.html>population limit</a> by 100.
  </li>
</ul>
