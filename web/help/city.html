<h1> Housing and Cities </h1>

<p>
A housing holds people. To increase the population, you need housing to
accomodate them. By default, every housing can be home to 2 persons. Having an
<a href=./architect.html>architect</a> within 8 tiles doubles that ratio.
Note that you need one person on each house tile to occupy it.

<p>
A city is a bunch of connected houses. If the city is connected
to <a href=./zones.html>water</a> (either directly or through a road), each
housing is home to one more person.
If the city is connected to <a href=./farm.html>farm land</a> by a road, the
number of plots of farm land counts as a food source. For every 16 plots, each
housing is home to one more person. However, farm lands can only be used for a
single city.
