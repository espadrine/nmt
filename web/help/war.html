<h1> War </h1>

<p>
When a group of persons goes on a tile with enemies, both your group and the
enemy's group lose the same number of persons. If you have more people, the
enemy's group is destroyed, and whatever remains of your group occupies the
tile. Otherwise, your group dies.
</p>
<p>
Having <a href=./manufacture.html>weapons</a> doubles your group's firepower.
For instance, a group of 2 with weapons going against an unarmed group of 3 will
win.
</p>
<p>
Given the loss that you must suffer to really make your enemy suffer,
coordinated war is advised.
