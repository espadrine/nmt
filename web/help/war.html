<h1> War </h1>

<p>
When a group of folks goes on a tile with enemies, both your group and the
enemy's group lose the same number of folks. If you have more people, the
enemy's group is destroyed, and whatever remains of your group occupies the
tile. Otherwise, your group dies.
</p>
<p>
Having <a href=./manufacture.html>weapons</a> doubles your group's firepower.
For instance, a group of 2 with weapons going against an unarmed group of 3 will
win, as if they were 4.
</p>
<p>
Fighting is tiresome: any group that fights will lose 5 units of
<a href=./food.html>food</a>.
</p>
<p>
Being located in a vegetation area (such as swamps, meadow, forests, or taiga)
protects you from harm: you get a 1.5x firepower bonus. On the other hand,
attacking from high ground (attacking steppes from hills, for instance) gives
you a 1.5x firepower bonus.
</p>
<p>
Each vehicle has its own pros and cons as well (bonuses give a 1.5x firepower
increase, maluses give a 0.5x firepower decrease):
</p>
<table>
  <tr><th> Vehicle   <th> Bonus against  <th> Malus against <th> Terrain bonus
  <tr><td> Car       <td> Artillery      <td> Plane         <td> Steppe, Meadow
  <tr><td> Boat      <td> Car, Artillery <td> Plane         <td> Water, Swamp
  <tr><td> Artillery <td> Car            <td> Boat          <td> Hill, Forest
  <tr><td> Plane     <td> Car, Artillery <td> Boat          <td> Mountain, Taiga
</table>
<p>
You can also make your enemy surrender by surroundering an enemy tile before
winning the battle against it. If it is surrounded by n tiles, n/6th of them
will instantly switch camp, increasing your
<a href=population.html>population</a> (but not your population cap).
</p>
<p>
Given the loss that you must suffer to really make your enemy suffer,
planning and coordination is advised.
