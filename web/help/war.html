<h1> War </h1>

<p>
When a group of folks goes on a tile with enemies, both your group and the
enemy's group lose the same number of folks. If you have more people, the
enemy's group is destroyed, and whatever remains of your group occupies the
tile. Otherwise, your group dies.
</p>
<p>
Having <a href=./manufacture.html>weapons</a> doubles your group's firepower.
For instance, a group of 2 with weapons going against an unarmed group of 3 will
win.
</p>
<p>
Being located in a vegetation area (such as swamps, meadow, forests, or taiga)
protects you from harm: you get a 1.5x firepower bonus.
<p>
You can also make your enemy surrender by having an enemy tile surrounded by at
least 2 tiles around them while you attack them. They will instantly switch
camp, increasing your <a href=population.html>population</a> (but not your
population cap), and you won't lose any folks.
</p>
<p>
Given the loss that you must suffer to really make your enemy suffer,
coordinated war is advised.
