<h1> Manufacture </h1>

<p>
A number of buildings can provide valuable artifacts to groups of people. In
every case, a group must walk on the manufacturer's tile to get the objects they
need.

<ul>
  <li> A <strong>Factory</strong> provides cars. They increase ground speed to
  16.
  <li> The <strong>Docks</strong> provide boats. They sail through
  <a href=./zones.html>water and swamps</a> at a speed of 20. Building docks
  requires two tiles.
  <li> The <strong>Airport</strong> provides planes. They fly at a speed of 32.
  Building an airport requires four tiles.
  <li> The <strong>Gunsmith</strong> provides weapons. They double a group's
  ability to <a href=./war.html>attack</a>.
</ul>
