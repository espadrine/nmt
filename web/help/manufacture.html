<h1> Manufacture </h1>

<p>
A number of buildings can provide valuable artifacts to groups of people. In
every case, a group must walk on the manufacturer's tile to get the objects they
need.
<p>
<ul>
  <li> A <strong>Factory</strong> provides cars. They increase ground speed to
  16.
  <li> The <strong>Docks</strong> provide boats. They sail through
  <a href=./zones.html>water and swamps</a> at a speed of 20. Building docks
  requires two tiles.
  <li> The <strong>Airport</strong> provides planes. They fly at a speed of 32.
  Building an airport requires four tiles.
  <li> The <strong>Gunsmith</strong> provides weapons. They double a group's
  ability to <a href=./war.html>attack</a>.
</ul>
<p>
Ownership of manufactured goods is per group.
When splitting a group on two tiles, both groups get all of the goodies.
However, when fusioning two groups together onto the same tile, the resulting
group gets the intersection of the goods. Be careful when building a big army!
Fusing a decked out army with a group that owns nothing makes a naked army.
