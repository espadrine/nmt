<h1> Resources </h1>

<p>
Some buildings require the use of resources.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of resources: wood and metal. Wood can be collected by
building lumber on a forest or a taiga. Metal can be collected by building a
mine on metal ores, which spawn randomly across the map.
</p>
<p>
Each time you use a resource for building, the corresponding cost sticks with
you, even if you destroy or abandon the building. You must keep folks working on
the corresponding lumber or mine tiles, in order not to lose those (already
spent) resources.
<p>
<p>
You can find metal ore in the "Places" menu. They are rarer than forests.
Also, forests tend to be located all at the same place, unlike metal. That means
that controlling a forest area gives you even more power.
