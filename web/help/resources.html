<h1> Resources </h1>

<p>
Some buildings require the use of resources.
</p>
<p>
There are four kinds of resources: <a href="wealth.html">wealth</a>, stock,
production and health.
Wealth can be collected through <a href="farm.html">farms</a> and managing
<a href="wealth.html">commodities</a>.
Stock can be collected by building lumber on a forest or a taiga.
Production can be produced by building a mine on metal ores,
which spawn randomly across the map, or industries right next to them.
</p>
<p>
You can extract even more from a resource location by allocating folks to it.
All you need to do is to move them to the plot of land that produces that
resource. You get one of that resource for each allocated worker, up to 2 for
farms, industries and fields, 4 for lumber, 8 for mines.
</p>
<p>
Each time you use a resource for building, the corresponding cost sticks with
you, even if you destroy or abandon the building. You must keep folks working on
the corresponding lumber or mine tiles, in order not to lose those (already
spent) resources.
<p>
<p>
You can find metal ore in the "Places" menu. They are rarer than forests.
Also, forests tend to be located all at the same place, unlike metal. That means
that controlling a forest area gives you even more power.
